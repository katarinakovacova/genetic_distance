# Genetic Distance Calculator

## Introduction

The Genetic Distance Calculator is a Python-based application designed to analyze and compare genetic sequences across various insect species. Leveraging the BOLD API, this tool automatically downloads genetic data and computes genetic distances using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, providing insights into the evolutionary relationships between different genera.

## Key Features

- **Genetic Distance Calculation**: Computes genetic distances between biological genera based on genetic sequence data using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, a dynamic programming approach for sequence alignment.
- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Utilizes the BOLD API to automatically download relevant genetic data for analysis.
- **Web Access**: The application is available online for easy access and interaction.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Allows comparison of genetic sequences across all insect species included in the dataset.

## Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a classic dynamic programming method used for sequence alignment. It is designed to find the optimal alignment between two sequences by maximizing their similarity. In this application, it is used to compute genetic distances by aligning genetic sequences and calculating the degree of similarity between them.
